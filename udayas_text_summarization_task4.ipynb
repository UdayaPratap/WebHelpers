It seems too bright although there are some defaults options like movies, sports etc.Tv remote is very light I think if it falls couple of time then it may break so need to get cover.Not sure about Full HD home screen seems low resolution not able to find any difference with HD\\nRead more', \"I recently purchased this tv.. overall the tv is good. I purshased FHD model so Picture quality is good as expected. And i have also connected it to my pc to play games.. worked finePros.1.Beautiful edge less design.2.Great picture quality.3.Gaming is good.4.Voice assistant works almost perfectly.5.Supports all ott platforms.6.You can install third-party apps also.Cons.1.Sound quality is okay but it is very low, you have to connect a external audio device to enjoy the content. I am using the tv at 100 volume and still it's not enough sometimes. So please don't buy it if you're looking for a loud sound tv.2.Ui is slow and hangs sometimes.3.Only 1 usb port so you can't use a mouse and a pendrive at once.4.No wall mount included.5.Free installation is a joke. They'll charge 350 to 400. If you want to mount it on a wall.6.Home screen interface has a low resolution, look bad sometimes.7.Sound modes doesn't really work at all.Conclusion: Don't get me wrong with the cons it's good tv with this price, but I'll recommend you to buy on a sale only with cr. card discounts n all.\\nRead more\", 'I purchased TCL t.v through online by AMAZON on 22nd  August delivered in my address.
